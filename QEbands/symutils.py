    First, some notes on conventions since people apparently cannot agree on basic things...
    Mathematically speaking, we simply have the relation between direct lattice and reciprocal lattice vectors:
               <a_i|b_j> = 2*pi delta_ij
    Both sets of lattice vectors can be arranged as a matrix (and this is where people can't agree).
    In most electronic structure codes (and ASE), the matrix of direct lattice vectors, A, is arranged row-wise,
    i.e. a lattice vector on each row.

    For the matrix of reciprocal lattice vectors (also ROW-wise), then we get
               B * A.T = 2*pi * I
    The transpose is necessary because we want a_i to be along the columns when multiplying out.
    ASE uses the convention where the lattice vectors are in units of 2*pi with B returned such that
               B * A.T = I
